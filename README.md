**NOTE: This project is being deprecated in favor of a more ambitious project: [https://github.com/EnSoftCorp/sidis-toolbox](https://github.com/EnSoftCorp/sidis-toolbox).**

This toolbox contains two tools,
- The on-demand statically computed Loop Call Graph (LCG)
- The Time Complexity Analyzer (TCA) instrumentation and empirical complexity measurement framework
